- The basic overlapping portfolio model with selling only either results in learning where (nearly) everyone survives or everyone dies. This outcome is persistent across different learning algorithms and different initial adverse scenarios. Therefore, Mingwei and I suspect that the model may be to basic to generate outcomes outside of the extremes of survival or failure by all. We propose to extend the model to include buying behaviour, so that undervalued assets will be bought by institutions who have the capacity and interest to do so, thereby playing a stabilising role in distressed markets. Mingwei will have a first go at developing this buying/selling overlapping portfolio model and will discuss this on Feb 7 with me. Christoph and I might be able to further advice Mingwei on how to set up this model well.
- It would be valuable to summarise the findings of the basic overlapping portfolio model with selling only in some plots. We propose to show the learning/survival outcome in the EU (EBA) or in a random financial system as a function of an increasing initial adverse impact (both homogeneous and heterogeneous shock) or increasing market illiquidity, for different learning algorithms. This allows us to not only show where the threshold of going from survival by all to failure by all lies, but also to demonstrate that indeed the basic model usually (or always) gives only extreme outcomes.
